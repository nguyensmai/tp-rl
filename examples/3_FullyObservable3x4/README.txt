This folder has 3 files:
- gridworld.py is the code representing the environment. You do not need to change anything in this file
- two files to implement your code for sarsa and q-learning algorithms. You will need to change the functions main, choose_action, update_state_action, update_policy where "#TODO INSTRUCTIONS" is written
- you can launch the algorithms with command 'python temporal_differencing_control_sarsa.py'. The results of the learning is displayed on the terminal
